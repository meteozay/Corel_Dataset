To be precise, 238th class contains 97 samples,\r\n342th and 376th classes contain 99 samples, and rest of the classes contain 100 samples. The\r\nemployed Haar and 7 of MPEG-7 visual features (descriptors) [2], [3] are summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Color Structure (Feature Space Dimension = 32),\r\n\r\n2. Color Layout (Feature Space Dimension = 12),\r\n\r\n3. Edge Histogram (Feature Space Dimension = 80),\r\n\r\n4. Region-based Shape (Feature Space Dimension = 35),\r\n\r\n5. Dominant Color (Feature Space Dimension = 16),\r\n\r\n6. Scalable Color (Feature Space Dimension = 64),\r\n\r\n7. Homogenous Texture (Feature Space Dimension = 62),\r\n\r\n8. Haar Descriptor (Feature Space Dimension = 195).\r\n\r\n## PROPERTIES OF THE MATLAB FILES\r\n\r\n### corel dataset all features labels.mat\r\nEach feature set and the set of class labels of the samples are given in individual matlab ”mat”\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nIn order to load the feature sets, you can use;\r\n\r\nload(’feature_name.mat’)\r\n\r\nIn order to load the class labels, you can use;\r\n\r\nload(’labels.mat’)\r\n\r\nThen, the matlab workspace contains the following variables:\r\n* color structure: Color Structure features;\r\n\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* color layout: Color Layout features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* edge histogram: Edge Histogram features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* region shape: Region-based Shape features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* dominant color: Dominant Color features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* scalable color: Scalable Color features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* homogenous texture: Homogenous Texture features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* haar descriptor: Haar Descriptor features;\r\n– N by Dj feature matrix, where N is the number of samples and Dj is the dimension of\r\nthe feature space.\r\n\r\n* labels: Labels of the samples;\r\n– N by 1 feature vector, where N is the number of samples.\r\n\r\n### class name and index.mat\r\n\r\n”class name and index.mat” is C by 2 matlab cell, where C  599 is the number of classes.\r\n\r\nIn order to load the dataset, you can use;\r\n\r\nload(’class_name_and_index.mat’)\r\n\r\nThe first column of the cell contains the category or class names, and the second column\r\ncontains the category or class identity numbers (i.e. ids). For instance, class name index{1,1}\r\nprovides the class name africa with the associated class id class name index{1,2} which is 1.\r\nTherefore, the class name of the 1st class is africa.\r\n\r\n## REFERENCES\r\n[1] M.
